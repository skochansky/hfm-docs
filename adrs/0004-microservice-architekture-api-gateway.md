## Context

In our current microservices architecture, we face challenges related to managing network traffic, authorization, monitoring, and load balancing efficiently.
There's a need for a unified point of interaction that simplifies communication between clients and our array of microservices
## Decision

- We propose the adoption of an API Gateway as the central point of entry into our microservices system.
- The API Gateway will act as a single entry point, handling requests and routing them to the appropriate microservice. It will also handle cross-cutting concerns like authentication, SSL termination, and rate limiting.
- This decision aims to simplify client interaction, centralize common tasks, and improve system maintainability and scalability.

## Consequences

- Positive Impacts:

  - Simplifies client interaction by providing a single entry point to multiple services.
  Centralizes common functionalities like authentication, monitoring, and logging, leading to consistency and easier maintenance.
  Facilitates service scalability and version management by abstracting the client from direct interactions with individual services.

- Negative Impacts:

  - Introduces a potential single point of failure in the system architecture.
  Might become a performance bottleneck if not properly scaled.
  Increases complexity in deployment and requires careful management and monitoring.
