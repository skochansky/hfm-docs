# ADR-0003: Functional Requirements and Boundaries for Home Budget Management Microservices Application  
  
Date: `2023-12-12`  
  
## Status  
  
Proposed
  
  
## Context  
  
Designing a microservices application for home budget management requires a clear definition of functional requirements and boundaries. These requirements and boundaries are essential for maintaining the modularity, independence, and scalability of the system.  
In a microservices context, "boundaries" refer to the clear delineations between individual services, defining their scope of responsibility, interactions, and dependencies  
  
## Decision  
  
We have decided to articulate the functional requirements of our home budget management microservices application, while clearly defining the boundaries for each microservice.  
Considering the application's scope, we have limited the design to a maximum of four microservices. The following are the proposed functional requirements with their respective boundaries:  
  
1. Transaction Management Service:  
  
- Boundary: This service handles all operations related to transactions, including tracking expenses and income.  
- Interactions: Communicates with the Budget Analysis and User Account Management services for data synchronization.

2. Budget Analysis Service:
- Boundary: Responsible for analyzing spending patterns, generating monthly and yearly summaries, and providing budget recommendations.  
- Interactions: Uses data from the Transaction Management Service and interfaces with the User Notification Service for alerts.  


3. User Account Management Service:
- Boundary: Manages user accounts, authentication, and authorization.  
- Interactions: Integrates with all other services for user verification and data access control.  

4. User Notification Service:
- Boundary: Handles sending notifications and alerts to users based on their budget and transaction activities.  
- Interactions: Works with the Budget Analysis Service to send relevant budget alerts and notifications.  

## Consequences  
  
Increased Overhead: Managing multiple repositories can lead to increased administrative overhead, including repository setup, access control, and dependency management.  
  
1. Coordination Effort: There will be a need for more coordinated effort in terms of cross-project changes, shared dependency updates, and overall communication between teams.  
  
2. Redundant Tooling: Each project may need to set up its own CI/CD pipelines, testing frameworks, and other tooling, which could lead to some redundancy and inefficiency.  
  
3. Consistency Challenges: Ensuring consistency across multiple repositories in terms of coding standards, tooling, and practices might require additional effort.  
  
4. Dependency Management: Each project will need to independently manage its dependencies, which could lead to challenges in aligning versions across projects.  
  
5. Overall, while the polyrepo approach has its challenges, we believe that its benefits align better with our project's needs, especially in terms of scalability, focused development, and risk mitigation.

## Decision  

We have decided to articulate the functional requirements of our home budget management microservices application, while clearly defining the boundaries for each microservice. Considering the application's scope, we have limited the design to a maximum of four microservices. The following are the proposed functional requirements with their respective boundaries:

1.  **Transaction Management Service**:
    
    -   **Boundary**: This service handles all operations related to transactions, including tracking expenses and income.
    -   **Interactions**: Communicates with the Budget Analysis and User Account Management services for data synchronization.
2.  **Budget Analysis Service**:
    
    -   **Boundary**: Responsible for analyzing spending patterns, generating monthly and yearly summaries, and providing budget recommendations.
    -   **Interactions**: Uses data from the Transaction Management Service and interfaces with the User Notification Service for alerts.
3.  **User Account Management Service**:
    
    -   **Boundary**: Manages user accounts, authentication, and authorization.
    -   **Interactions**: Integrates with all other services for user verification and data access control.
4.  **User Notification Service**:
    
    -   **Boundary**: Handles sending notifications and alerts to users based on their budget and transaction activities.
    -   **Interactions**: Works with the Budget Analysis Service to send relevant budget alerts and notifications.
## Consequences  
  

1.  **Clear Separation of Responsibilities**: Each microservice will have well-defined tasks and scopes of responsibility.
    
2.  **Complexity in Management**: This approach requires meticulous planning and management to ensure consistency and effective communication between services.
    
3.  **Essential Orchestrations**: Effective operation of the microservices will necessitate the creation of orchestration and choreography mechanisms.
    
4.  **Scalability**: This will enable easy scaling of individual parts of the system depending on requirements and load.
    
5.  **Integration Challenges**: Integrating various services can be challenging and will require the use of appropriate design patterns.
