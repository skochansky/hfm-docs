# Adoption of C4 Model Diagrams for Microservice Architecture

Date: '2023-13-16`

## Status

Accepted 

## Context

In our current microservice architecture, we face challenges in effectively visualizing and communicating the system's design among team members and stakeholders.
The complexity of the architecture, with its numerous services, databases, and external systems, makes it difficult to understand interactions and dependencies.
This lack of clarity often leads to inefficiencies in development, troubleshooting, and scaling processes.

## Decision

- We propose to adopt the C4 model for visualizing our microservice architecture. The C4 model, consisting of Context, Containers, Components, and Code diagrams, offers a structured approach to depict different levels of abstraction in our system.
- This decision will facilitate better understanding and communication of our system architecture. It will enable developers, architects, and non-technical stakeholders to gain a clearer picture of how different parts of the system interact. We will use Structurizr as a tool for maintaining and providing these C4 diagrams, ensuring consistent and up-to-date visual representations.

## Consequences

- Adopting the C4 model will simplify the process of onboarding new team members, as they can quickly understand the system's architecture through these diagrams.
- It will also make it easier to identify potential issues or improvements in our architecture.
- Over the long term, this decision should lead to more efficient development cycles, better architectural decisions, and improved scalability and maintainability of our microservices.
- However, it requires an initial investment in time and resources to create and maintain these diagrams, and there's a learning curve for team members unfamiliar with the C4 model.
